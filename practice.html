		<summary>More of Chile</summary>
		Chile is a country that is positioned in South America, in the southern zone. It's a beautiful country, it has a desert (the most arid of the world), a lot of glaciers, forests and national parks that I hope visit someday (don't worry, I'll send photos, or better, upload here).

		<summary>More of my Life</summary>
		<div>I born in the south of Chile, in a country region, a beautiful place, even today. My mother's family lives in that region, but I live in the capital of Chile, Santiago of Chile, the highest city.</div> 
		<div>I'm a city person, I love tall buildings, and busy streets. I can't imagine myself living in a quiet place, not during my youth at least. Anyway, I love nature, that's one of the reasons I went vegan.</div>
